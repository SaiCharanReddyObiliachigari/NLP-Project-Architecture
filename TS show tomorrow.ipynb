Eventually the edible rubble became just a smear on the specially decorated Hula Pie plate as we lapped up all of the deliciousness of this inventive and fabled dish.  \n",

There's two options -- upstairs for more formal dining (make reservations) or first come first serve downstairs with the less expensive bar menu. Definitely sit downstairs as the view of the water is much much better and try to get a table on the south side (to the left when looking at the water) for the best sunset view. Wasn't hard to snag an open table. There was live music with a very talented musician and not super loud so we were able to still have a conversation. Servers were very nice if a bit distracted and slow to check in. Main complaint here is we waited almost an hour for our food to arrive.

      "We had a reservation at 8:15 for 6 people. We checked in at around 6 o'clock because we were walking around, killing time and hungry. We asked if they had anything earlier than our reservation and the lady told us we were better off keeping our time slot because that's how long the wait would be anyways. That could have been either a bad sign or a good sign that they are THAT busy because they are THAT good... So we decided to keep our reservation and continued to shop, returning to the restaurant at 8 to check in. The host asked if we had a preference of where we wanted to sit and since we didn't she took us in right away and placed us upstairs in the back corner near the balcony. Our waiter came by introduced himself and filled are cups up with ice water. About 10-15 minutes later our waiter came by and explained the fish menu to us... everything sounded good. After some time we noticed our waiter taking a order from the table of 10 across from us, who were seated minutes after us. We weren't too happy about that because of course we were hungry and we didn't even have our drink or appetizer order in. All good though, we waited patiently. By 830ish we had our food and drink order in and had our dinner by 9:00. I ordered the lobster topping meal... I'd say it was just okay. The rice tasted old and dry, I couldn't even eat it. The panko crust on my fish tasted old and stale, I diluted it with my honeys lobster butter just to have a better taste. The veggies were bland. All in all I was not pleased with the dish. I expected much more than that due to all the reviews. They have thousands of reviews and 4 stars, but my meal was not one of those. This place is overpriced and overly hyped for reasons other than their food, maybe the view or bar or maybe just because it's a tourist trap. This place is really just average. Save your money and find another spot to spend it on because there is better in the area.\n",

      "3 stars for service, 4 stars for food.  We were brought to a dirty table that didn't even get wiped off all the way once we got there.  Our waitperson Evan didn't come by to see if we wanted more drinks during our meal, which we would have ordered.  The shrimp and beet salad was good although shrimp with tails is not really the most practical thing for a salad but the basil vinaigrette was perfect for this salad.  My husband did enjoy the fish and chips and said the fish tasted quite fresh and the batter was delicious.  He doesn't usually like coleslaw but found theirs to be light and delicious with a more vinegary dressing.  I'm pretty sure my pina colada did not have any rum in it although it was tasty.  Perhaps we just came on an off day for the staff.\n",

I requested that table and the hostess (a super nice young girl) was prompt to organize cleaning and setting up that table for me. Five stars for hostess! \n",

      "4 - Service. I got a very nice waitress, who worked at Kimo's for 15 years. Very smily, energetic and nice. The downside - I had to refill my champagne glass (from the bottle I ordered) on my own since she got busy with new visitors. \n",
      "5 - Food. Based on recommendations from Yelp - I chose to order baked fish (mahi mahi) topped with Lobster salad. It came with pilaf rice and some veggies. The portion size was splendid for me. The food was good - fish was juicy, rice was soft. But it lack a kink to make this meal taste excellent. While the menu items were interesting and attractive, the food preparation was just ok (to my taste). And food presentation was quite basic. The chef's special Hula Pie was gigantic (I think enough for at least 4 people). It's hard to go wrong with ice cream, but again this one was too sweet to my taste. \n",

      "Place was nice a bit upscale or atleast it felt like it .kinda packed after we beat the traffic no locals only tourists, sat upstairs great view , had in mind my whole meal , teryaki steak and lobster , everything was great food was great except for 2 things that kept it from a full 5 star , 1. The bread being served was carrot muffins, I expected dinner rolls like the pic of past vists ,i guess they stopped serving good dinner rolls and only serve local carrot cake which is fine but carrot cake doesnt go good with steak and lobster or even a ceaser salad for god sake that was terrible, the carrot muffins were ok but just not the bread you expect with dinner . 2. My lobster was sized good but it had some sauce on top i wish they would ask if you want that on top or not , it didnt ruin my lobster it was ok but both my girls were like wth is this. Im not that fancy pantsy give me a boiled lobster tail with a side of butter and lemon. We all agreed a 5 star was not for this place although the service was great and food was good , we agreed on a 4 star those two things almost gave them a 3 star , i mean ruth chris is across the street and I probably woulda ate there twice if i had known this was going to happen but no biggie to each their own a 4 is what they get edged out 4\n",

We had reservations and they gave us a beautiful ocean facing, front row seat, which was perfectly breezy during the hot day, and away from the noise, as it can be a little noisy.  The servers were attentive and knowledgable.  I love the carrot muffins to start, non traditional but I'm big on Sweet's.  I opted for the coconut crusted Marlin with peanut sauce and pineapple salsa, it definitely had a kick, which I loved, and the portion was very size able for the price.  My hubby had the lobster topped Mahi Mahi and enjoyed it as well.  The pilaf and side vegetables were cooked deliciously.  The lava flow was delicious, definitely a sweet smoothie type beverage, but great on a hot day with great strawberry and pineapple flavor.  Would definitely come again.  They also gave us a complimentary slice of Hula Pie for our anniversary, which FYI, is gigantic and can easily be shared between 4-6.\n",

Once we got seated the server was really good about explaining all the fish preparations and some of her favorite dishes on the menu.

The food was good and the fish was cooked to perfection. Their Hula pie was over hyped and I did not find anything special about it. It was basically a big slice of ice cream with chocolate drizzled on top with crushed macadamia nuts and the ice cream had no flavor. You could probably skip on dessert here and head down Front street to find ice cream or shaved ice elsewhere. Public parking and expect to pay at least $10 for 2 hours.

Fast forward to my retirement years and I made it a priority to return to Kimo's.  I can't say that it was a disappointment but I will say that my tastes have refined over the years.  Let me explain.\n",

If you are lucky enough to get a seat down below on the beach side of the restaurant, you can't ask for a nicer open-air restaurant ocean view in Lahaina.  It is so pretty, great ambiance, a gorgeous bar and nice drinks.  \n",

Take it for what it is--a local eatery with the usual island entrees of fish, teriyaki courses, steaks, burgers etc....  I ordered the Kushiyaki and enjoyed it very much.  The meat was tender and the flavors fresh.  My husband ordered the special of Moonfish with a citrus-herb sauce.  The first couple bites were moist, tender and delicious but as he continued, the flesh lost its moist texture.  He did love the citrus-herb sauce that accompanied it but there just wasn't enough of it on the plate to have on every bite.  To finish, I ordered the Hula Pie to see if it was as delicious as I had remembered and it didn't disappoint.  Chocolate cookie crust filled with macadamia ice cream and topped with roasted macadamia nuts, hot fudge and whipped cream--what's not to like, right?!  \n",

If I was with my husband, probably not because of two reasons.  Number one, he wasn't impressed and number 2, we have so many more restaurants to try that are on our \"must try\" list.  \n",

When my mom said she didn't care for mahi mahi (not her taste, not my favorite fish either), the waitress got VERY defensive and said, \"Well, it's a very good fish, where have you had it before?\"  My mom said, \"Here.  I just don't like it.\"  She forgot to bring my mom's Diet Coke.  I ordered an ono sandwich without cole slaw, and we had a big discussion about it with the waitress telling me how it added crunch to the sandwich, and I still said, \"I don't want it.  No cole slaw.\"  My sandwich came with a huge helping of cole slaw.  The fish was fine.  The Ceasar salad was what made me start eating lettuce, but now I can say it's not the best.

We all ordered a different fish so we could share and coincidentally we each ordered our favorite! I had the traditional mojito and ended up ordering one more! Yum! With reservations we had no wait!

      "My husband and I shared the chopped chicken salad (Grilled chicken, applewood smoked bacon, avocado, tomatoes, corn, edamame, Kalamata olives, Asian pear, chick peas, buttermilk dressing) before dinner which our waitress split onto two plates for us.  It was absolutely AMAZING!  We ate every bite.  For dinner we had the fish and chips with Lava Flow Cocktails.  The fish was flavorful and delicious, but the thicker pieces were not cooked all the way through and I am not a fan of sushi.  We sat right on the beach and watched the sunset, we even got splashed a few times by overly aggressive waves.  We topped off the meal with the infamous Hula Pie (macadamia nut ice cream piled high on a chocolate cookie crust and topped with chocolate fudge, whipped cream, and more macadamia nuts) Oh MY!  My husband and I literally had spoon fights over the cookie crust.  On nights that we did not eat at one of the four associated restaurants that served this amazing dish, I went to bed craving it.  It is a must have at Dukes, Kimo's, Hula Bar and Lelanis.  This would be a 5 star review if it were not for the pieces of fish that were undercooked.\n",

      "When our appetizers arrived our server informed us she had dropped one of the shrimp and would bring us another, she literally brought a plate with one single shrimp, I understand she dropped one but for the inconvenience I expected a little more. Speaking from experience as a server that is what I would have done. \n",

      "As I am not 21 (I'm 20)I did not order an alcoholic beverage but my Mum allowed me to take a sip of her drink, our server came over to the table and said \"Can you refrain from drinking that as Hawaii has strict liquor laws\" I understood but her tone was really rude and condescending. As a visitor I was unaware, to my knowledge if you're parents consent to you sipping their beer then that is ok. A better tone and approach to this situation would have enhanced my visit. \n",
      "The food was delicious but for the price that was being asked for I would have expected to be treated better. Throughout the meal while refilling waters our server continued to splash me which might have been accidental I don't know but it was not pleasant. As we got to the end of our meal there was a couple behind us looking for service and we made this known to our server and she acknowledged that and just walked back to the kitchen, the couple were not helped for another 10mins. I assume since it was not her table. \n",
      "At Kimo's they sing for you if it is your birthday and when this happened it was ingenious and awkward. They wanted it to be over as fast and as soon as possible. Then it came to the bill, she gave us one free dessert (for my mother's birthday) and then we had a voucher for another free dessert our server took it upon herself to decide that we were only allowed to have one free dessert. \n",

If you're not aware, this is one of several TS Restaurants on the island (along with Dukes and Hula Grill). They are all basically the same type restaurant with similar food. Seafood is definitely the way to go (Kimo's style and the coconut crusted are best) - although my son had the teriyaki steak and it was awesome. The muffins that they serve before dinner are a bit random (liked the fresh bread at Duke's better) - and like Duke's the cocktails were a disappointment and overpriced. Overall though, the food, atmosphere and location in Lahaina make it a worthwhile Maui dinner spot!\n",

Kimo style fish was very good (Opa) with the right amount of spices and cooked to perfection.  And the hostess was gracious enough to find one of the very best seats in the house for our family of four.  \n",
      "Here are the knocks: We waited 25 minutes BEFORE we had our order taken.  That starts off any meal with a negative vibe and really didn't apologize or acknowledge the long wait.  The place is huge and quite a production.  Like a well oiled machine, we were passed to many people throughout the night, from the host, to the table guide, to the drink taker, to the waiter to the busboy.  I'm sure its necessary but lacks the intimacy of something you would expect in the spirit of Hawaii.  The Shrimp Pappaderelle pasta was much too rich either from excessive amounts of butter and/or salt.  The lighting was very dim and hard to read the menu.  And the kicker, 12 oz pint glasses!  Is it really that much of a splurge to have a 16 oz pint of draft beer for $8?  Of course this place is quite pricey but average for the location.\n",

      "Came here with the BF about a month ago for date night while on vacation and it was perfect. We were able to snag a table right around 6ish before it got too crazy and had a great view of the ocean/sunset. That particular day had some pretty bad tide/waves crashing in so they had to take out tables closest to the water that were in the \"splash zone\". That particular area is great for capturing the perfect sunset photo. The drinks were amazing, we had the lava flow, mango colada and mango mojito. All of them were fresh, tangy and sweet and packed an alcoholic punch. The food was even better. I ordered the mahi mahi topped with lobster and my bf ordered their house special mahi mahi and both dishes were the best mahi mahi we have ever had. Seriously it will ruin other mahi mahi for you! We also ordered the poke/avocado dish as an appetizer. I thought the poke was so fresh and light and didn't taste too fishy. I'm not usually the biggest fan of poke (my bf loves it) but I really enjoyed this appetizer and recommend. I would not recommend the brussel sprouts/potatoe hash side unfortunately. It came out more as a salad than a hash and not nearly enough brussel sprouts so that was slightly disappointing. Other than that our experience was great and the service was friendly, quick and attentive. They also had live music towards the end of our dinner going into the rest of the evening, super fun! We were both very happy after dining here and would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to Maui.\n",

When it did show up, the server was nice enough to actually split it into 2 plates for us along with the side of veggies and mashed potatoes. But it was like we got separate halves of 2 different pieces of meat! Mine was the fattier end but was cooked to a perfect medium rare, super juicy and tender. My husbands was the more meaty half but was a solid well done with no pink and was drier, tough, and lacked salt. When he took a bite and seemed unhappy we eat tried each other's and it seriously seemed as if we were eating two different cuts of prime rib. The lobster tail was also extremely over cooked, dry, and lacked any flavor even after I drenched it in butter and lemon.\n",

      "Are you new to Maui? Are you a repeat visitor and looking for a \"home base\" from which to jump-start your Hawaiian getaway? Look no further than Kimo's, which has established quite a reputation for being a go-to spot for visitors and I would assume locals who host visitors as well. You won't feel like you're stuck in a tourist trap here, rather you will feel welcomed by the egregious and friendly staff, you'll be tempted by their many fish and seafood options, and you will salivate over the many delicious-sounding cocktails on the extensive menu. Oh, and it's cliche, but you do need to try the Hula Pie, especially because you receive a coupon for a complimentary slice on your next visit to Kimo's or their sister restaurant, Duke's (see my review for Duke's for Hula Pie deets :) ).\n",

They were meaty yet tender, and didn't exude any of the fatty throwaway that's so common with ribs, so they were a tantalizing way to begin our first Maui meal. Entree-wise, I opted for the Fresh Fish Tacos, which truly were FRESH and also refreshingly served on corn tortillas, as they should be - fish was grilled, not over-salted or blackened, and served with just enough pico de gallo to add some bright flavor to the fish without taking away from the flavor of the fresh catch itself. My husband ordered the Fresh Island Fish, which is basically a roasted fillet of fresh-caught local fish, served up with a local salad and heirloom tomatoes. Again, simple and lets the fish speak for itself without unnecessary preparation or garnishes. Entrees are all priced around $18, so it's very reasonable, and portion sizes are plentiful.\n",

We headed towards the bar, and were greated by Seldon (the Bartender). He immediately recommended the MaiTai which I chose and we got two Lahaina Lemomades. The MaiTai was awesome! I've easily had 8-10 different MaiTais this trip and this one was in the top 3. It was not too sweet and you could taste the alcohol. The lemonade (Lahaina) was tart. Reminded me of pink lemonade I used to have as a kid. We were then escorted to our table about an hour later. We got ocean front so the extra wait was not a problem. Our server LUKE aka TASER (because there are two Luke's) was very aware of the menu and went through each of the fish preparations by memory. Being in the industry, I was impressed by his knowledge of the food and drink menu. So onto the food: We started with a Beet Salad and Coconut Shrimp. The coconut shrimp were amazing. Extremely crispy and you could actually taste the coconut in the breaking. I twisted a Lemon onto it and was in heaven. The beet salad on the other hand was slightly disappointing. The flavor was good but, there was maybe four very small squares of purple beet and 4 of yellow beet on my plate. I would have liked a lot more beet considering it was a beet salad.'it was more like an arugula salad with and pinch of beet than anything, but, like I said the flavor profile was really good. The fish offered was Mahi Mahi, Wahoo and Marlin. On the menu, it seems as if you can pick your fish and chose a preparation (seasoning) but, don't be fooled, they actually only offer one type of fish per preparation type based on the chefs decision. We got the coconut crusted fish (2which was Marlin) and it was delicious!! Only thing is that it had a Spicy sauce on it. A chili like sauce the server and menu failed to mention. We also got the prim rib: holy schmokes!!! Juicy! Tender! And AMAZING!! We added on the Lobster Tail which had an aoli on it and again, out of this world! We tried the Seared Ahi plate and although on the small side, it was awesome! Other drinks our party tried: pina colada- good balance of coconut and pineapple.

The meat was falling off the bone and that plum sauce was great. \n",

I ordered a regular hamburger and it was OK.  I tried poke (pronounced po-kay) for the first time here and it's just like a ceviche.  We got the ahi tuna poke served with chips. The tuna was really fresh so I give them that.  If you choose outdoor seating on the deck, you literally face the water. But be warned that the waves can splash onto the deck. There were several times when the heavy tides were approaching and the water splashed onto the table. Thank goodness, it's the Hawaii ocean water and not the East River of NYC.

Meat was very tender and great texture.  They trimmed the edges which, unfortunately, happens to be the fattiest, tastitest, and my favorite part.  Without it, it was just bite after bite of pink meat...so it gets kind of bleh after a while. Mash potatoes side was heaven.\n",

      "I haven't sat down to dinner yet - and the food may be good - but this restaurant is guilty of one of my biggest pet peeves --- we made a reservation for a table near the water and arrived on time only to be told in a rather indifferent tone that we would have to wait beyond our reservation to get a table. I asked how long and got a clipped \"I don't know.\" It's now been 45 minutes. Most good restaurants will cruise by the tables and give you some sense of whether people have just ordered or may be about to leave. And no apology. I don't mind Waiting 10 or 15 minutes and I know that sometimes things get out of their control. But having to wait more than a half hour - without any effort to give us an update - tells me the restaurant cares little about customer service.  There are a lot of great and equally busy restaurants in Lahaina so far this week we've eaten in several of them - and we were treated far better and the food was great. I'll stick to those in the future. I'm giving them one star because the food may be good - but I reserve the right to take that one back if it's not worth the wait.\n",

      "My husband and I came here to eat after shopping around Lahaina. We were greeted by a friendly staff and were led to a table that overlooked the water which was beautiful because we got there while the sun was setting. My husband and I both indulged in their signature mai tais which came in fun tiki glasses. We split the ahi poke and avocado tower appetizer which was made well and with fresh ingredients but did not really stack up to other ahi poke appetizers we had while on Maui. We loved both of our main courses, my husband had the ono baked Kimo's style and I had the parmesan crusted opakapaka. They had a mix up in the kitchen with my entree, but we had no where to be so we didn't mind the delay. They gave us a Hula Pie for free after the mix up and it was SO GOOD. We didn't leave a crumb on the plate. We will definitely be coming back here when we make it back to Maui one day.\n",

Grab a free Hula pie coupon from one of the nearby retailers.  Usually if you look somewhat interested in what's in their store they will offer you a coupon if you mention you're going to Kimo's. 2. Order the ginormous 32 oz Prime Rib and split it among 2 to 3 persons. 3.  Get the free Hula dessert. It's so big it will feed 2-3 people. The end result?  For around $35 (minus drinks) you get a delicious meal for 2 to 3 people!\n",

However, our dining experience over the past couple of years have been disappointing compared to prior years.  On our most recent visit this year in 2016, our food was not served hot for any of the five people in our party.  It wasn't overly crowded so there was no acceptable reason why they could not get our meals to the table in a prompt fashion. For the price, we expected the dinner to be higher quality and not lukewarm.  Perhaps going at lunch would be a better and less expensive option. Maybe they have changed owners? If not, hopefully they will once again return to serving the quality food and service that we once enjoyed at Kimo's.\n",

We figured it was an isolated reaction to food/spices--did not make a big deal about it, but the astute manager noted she was not eating her food.

The beef was very good and tender--not always the case with prime rib.  On the downside the steak knife was more dull than the butter knives.  I asked for a replacement and it was just as bad.

I was still hungry after I finished it, which is saying something; and at $13+, definitely not worth it.  It was good tho, don't get me wrong, just not worth the amt paid for it.

The tiger shrimp tasted pretty good, but you only get 5 pieces, so it's not much bang for your buck. The teriyaki chicken was very good, not dry as I expect most skewers to be. The ribs were okay, tender and flavorful, but not outstanding. The macaroni salad was not the best, we've had better on the island. I especially enjoyed my coconut crusted island fish though.

It was late, so our options were limited and we weren't expecting much because it seemed like a chain/ touristy kind of place, but the food was actually very good and the service was great! Tracy was our server and she was polite and efficient. It was busy in the restaurant, but she was on top of it and knew what we needed without us having to say anything. Overall it was a very good experience and I would go back! Of course, it doesn't hurt that it's in Maui!!\n",

Passable but unexciting. The quinoa salad that it came with was inedible, horribly soggy. The vegetables were somewhat overcooked. The coconut crusted island fish was a bit better. The Klassic burger was OK. The bathroom door was very sticky too. Probably won't go back.\n",

      "My husband and I chose Kimo's based on these reviews, we had high expectations and we were beyond disappointed at the end of the night. We had the pork lettuce wraps and they were great! But that was the only great thing the entire night.... We asked for our servers advice on selecting our entrees, they all sounded delicious. I ordered the Marlin coconut crusted and he ordered the Ono parmesan crusted. We eat a lot of seafood back home and are pretty familiar with many types of fish. The marlin was so dry and overcooked, I could barely cut through it with my fork. I've had meatier fish (ex swordfish) before and this was just awful. It was like chewing beef jerky. The server offered to make a new entree for me, I hated being that person to return my dinner but it was just bad. My husbands Ono was okay, we've had it elsewhere since being in Maui and it was much better other places. The server brought the citrus Munchong within a few minutes. The Munchong was cooked much better, it was very tasty. It came along with asparagus and shaved Parmesan, delicious right?? WRONG! The asparagus was cold! It must have been cooked prior and then they attempted to heat it up but it was disgusting. Overall, we were so disappointed in the decision to eat at Kimo's. I would rather have eaten at a chain restaurant, at least that's what it felt like by the end of the night. They over-promise and under-deliver .... Think again before eating here. I know some of be reviews rave about this place but it is not worth it.\n",

I heard about Kimo's on yelp and on t.v. as well, so we tried it out.  We were very happy with it.  We got there right when they opened for lunch, so we got a primo table right on the edge of the patio overlooking the water.  The burgers were really good, the fries were really good, and to top it off, there were a couple whales out today giving us a show.  So we got a bonus whale-watching experience.  The wait staff was nice too.  I'll definitely come back here again if we ever find ourselves back in Maui.\n",

      "First, yelp puts this place at $$; try more like $$$-$$$$. Second, you are obviously putting extra $'s in based solely on the view and not on the food. Great place to get an overcooked, oversauced beautiful cut of fish. It is criminal that this quality of fish is treated so poorly by what must be minimally line cooks. Opah shoud be succulent, flakey, buttery, juicy and lightly seasoned to highlight the quality and not the sauce. Somehow Kimo's manages to push it to the limit leaving it dry and chewy. They then add \"Kimo's Style\" which is a greasy (vegetable oil, not olive oil) over-seasoned sauce to bring back the life. Their only saving grace is that the fish started out very high quality. For $30 an entree, I expect expert preparation. I got a far better prepared fish for $10 elsewhere on the island.  BTW, the view isn't so great to justify that extra $ and the whole atmosphere is cheesy.\n",

The one thing that I did LOVE was the pumpkin muffins and rolls. Mmmmmmm!! They were super delicious and filled me up nicely with my salad. The service was very slow while we were there.

Since it was dark, we couldn't really see the water but it was nice none the less.  I ordered the swordfish and it was tasty.  The rice however didn't satisfy my taste buds.  It was kind of crunchy, maybe overcooked and there was a side of \"cole slaw\" (not really sure what it was) and it was good.  My wife had the shrimp and steak dinner and tore it up.  The steak was a little dry but she did order it medium well.  The shrimp was delicious and a good size.  We shared the highly recommended Hula Pie and WOW, yummy!  Save room for this because you will not want to miss out on this dessert.  Lastly I had a mai tai and it was pretty good, much better than the one at Cheeseburger in Paradise.  Reservations are recommended.  We called earlier in the day and there was no wait for us.  Service was great!

I was not disappointed. It was a nice 14 oz med-rare cut with 2 huge mound of white rice (got to love that you can get white rice anywhere on the island!) I got the 32 oz last time and it was just too big.  Before we ordered they brought over a basket of warm rolls and pumpkin carrot muffins (oh, yeah!)  and we finished off the meal with their Hula Pie.   We came back here on our last day for lunch. Not as great as our last experience, I ordered the fish taco.....again, dried out.  What is up with seafood restaurants over cooking their fish???!

I prefer to dine at Kimo's for lunch and sit on the 'Lanai' so I can take in a bit of sun with my meal.  Their lunch menu isn't very large but they have a good selection of pupus (appetizers), sandwiches, salads, and entrees.  Their Wo Hing Salad ($7.95) has fresh Maui grown greens, roasted peanuts, wontons, and sesame dressing is great.  You can add a teriyaki chicken breast ($11.95) or fresh grilled fish ($12.95) to your salad to make it a meal.  Me, I usually opt for the Black Angus Cheeseburger ($9.95) which is a 1/2 pound of beef with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, and Maui onion on an onion bun.  Their sandwiches and burgers all come with Maui chips.  This burger tastes great after a day of walking on Front St. in the Maui sun and you're hungry and ready to cool down for a bit.\n",

I for some reason cannot go to Kimo's for lunch or stop by at night and not have a slice of this heavenly pie.  It's got a cookie crust and is stuffed with macadamia nut ice cream, and topped with hot fudge, whipped cream and more nuts!  The slice is HUGE and can easily feed 2-3 people.

Be warned if you can't take the heat. We had the shrimp ravioli, Parmesan crusted fish, sesame tuna (cooked rare) and fish tacos. All of them were very tasty and good portions.

You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and we have tried and enjoyed the wings, fries, fish tacos, Cobb salad (any of their salads are tasty) burgers (super-amazing), fish and chips.  The fish tacos are the best ever.  Fish when visiting Maui is a must anyway.  Each and every year we find the staff super-awesome, friendly, helpful, and who provide great attentive service.  The atmosphere outside on the patio is casual.  The food comes out fairly quickly.  If you parked in the parking structure, they give you a 4 hour stamp, so parking there is free for 4 hours which is a savings since parking there is $6/hr.

Although Leilani's was not as highly rated as others, we gave it a try.  And let me tell you, they knocked it out of the park.  First of all, the service was as good as you could ask for at any restaurant.  And, it was consistently good from start to finish.  There were four of us.  We had two orders of the Parmesan Crusted fish, the sirloin steak and a grilled shrimp plate (not on the menu, but per our waiter you can ask for it).  The food was excellent.  We finished off our meal with the Hula Pie.  It took all four of us to eat it.  If you have room for it, I would highly recommend getting it.  It was so good.  In summary, great food, great service and, on top of all that, a great view.  We've had a number of really memorable dinners over the years, this one will now be one of them.

Also, the service does not have the fun, aloha spirit that it use to have.  Very disappointing this year.  We still love JD and his music though - but he doesn't play as frequently as he use to.

      "Unfortunately, our most recent trip to Leilani's went off the rails before we even ordered anything.  I'm traveling with family - a group of 12 - and we're quite accustomed to jumping through a few hoops to get a table.  Wait was less than an hour on a relatively busy evening, which wasn't bad at all.  Hostess let us know in advance that we might be split into two tables - again, no big deal.  We get seated and are pleasantly surprised to find that the two tables were right next to each other.  Perfect - we can just scoot them together right?  \n",
      "\n",
      "Not a chance, according to our server.  Different sections, different servers.  Shouldn't be a big deal, just split the table between servers, right?  NOPE. Apparently there's an impenetrable wall between our tables.  Server never even apologized or even appeared to be sympathetic.  Didn't ask anyone, didn't so much as make an attempt at letting us sit together.  DIFFERENT SECTIONS she implores over and over, as though that matters in even the slightest.  They're 3 feet apart, I plead - but the Leilani's Server Armistice of 2018 prohibits us from visiting one another, as though we're in the West Bank and grandma and grandpa are in Jerusalem.\n",
      "\n",
      "So there we sat, isolated from the rest of our party because it was more important to our server to not share a tip.  Food came to our tables 20 minutes apart, and we ended up sitting at our table long after we paid our tab while we waited for the other half of our party to be served. (Picture included with this review just to alleviate any concerns about exaggeration.)\n",

When the burgers were served we needed to ask for salt and pepper since there was none on the table.  Our medium rare burgers were very over done, well done doesn't describe them.  There were no more than 8 fries on a plate, guess they didn't feel the need to tell us we needed to order extra fries since we were splitting the burgers.  After we ate we tried in vain to find our waiter to get the check.  Finally, a manager named Brandy stopped by the table to see how things were.  We told her!  She apologized and said she would find our server.  A few minutes later she returned, no server, and said we would not be charged for our \"meal\".  Thank you Brandy, you are appreciated.

      "Killer view right next to Whaler's village and all the beach goers along Ka'anapali beach. The food was just okay and their menu carries the standard resort burgers, nachos and seafood. Their appetizer beachside nachos (13$) were pretty meh, with not enough guac. The ahi poke bowl (18$) was crazy loaded on saltiness.. not even balanceable with the taro chips. The fresh fish tacos (19$) were the slightly more redeeming part of the meal, with super fresh large slabs of mystery fish (they don't tell you what it is). The famous hula pie (10$) was more like an ice cream cake covered with chocolate and whipped cream. Flavor-wise, it was very bland, not even much vanilla flavor.\n",

Drinks were delicious, food was divine and service was top notch!  We started with the ahi app with taro chips.  The flavors were smooth and subtle, as to not overpower the tuna.  I had the flat iron steak.  It melted in my mouth.  My husband ordered the pork chop and the glaze was superb:  sweet, with the right amount of tang.  We ended our dinner with hula pie.  Not what our tummies needed, but we almost finished that, too.\n",

We usually go for lunch and almost always order the fish tacos.  They are amazing!!!  The fish is always fresh and we like that it's grilled, so not greasy, and you can actually taste the fish.  The sauce they use adds a great flavor and you can either order it with or without a cajun spice rub.  We have always had great servers here and everyone is friendly.

Our server was friendly and prompt. For our appetizer, we ordered the chowder which was flavorful and yummy. We ordered the scallops, which were quite delicious and buttery. I do wish there were more mashed potatoes with the scallops. We also ordered the king crab legs, which came with quite a bit of meat. It would be better if the side of rice was more flavored than just being plain rice. The dish did not have much flavor (but that could be the point of having fresh crab legs). During our dinner it began drizzling a bit, and the servers promptly rolled out an overhead canopy to protect the open patio area from rain.

My husband and I are LA-based and the time difference between LA and Maui was never a problem. Kako was always very responsive, helpful and flexible. And as I'm sure you read from the other reviews, the oceanfront views from the restaurant are simply breathtaking.

We ordered fish tacos (award winners, apparently) and the Kalua pork egg rolls. The fish tacos were definitely generic. The tortillas were nothing special.

      "Leilani's was very crowded but it's a big place, so we were seated in under five minutes without reservations. They had live music playing which was nice and the Staff were just as pleasant as anyone could be. The service was good but to be really honest, we thought the food left a lot to be desired. The prime rib was just a bit warmer than coming straight out of the cooler. As prime rib goes the taste was below o.k., but serving it at room temp. or colder just wasn't very pleasing. I was so hungry I just grinned and bared it, I should have really sent it back. My wife's steak had a little bit more flavor but the outside was seared and the inside was raw as raw could be, she ordered it medium and the outside was medium/well and the inside was rare/raw. Nice environment to kick back and relax but we will never go there again for a meal. I think because of the crowd the kitchen was just pushing out orders as fast as they could. I'm assuming the prime rib was already made, so they made my plate while waiting for the steak to cook without putting under a warmer. Then the steak was cooked on very high heat, so the outside was seared that left the inside raw. Sorry, when seeing the ambience there I really hoped it could be a higher rated restaurant. The two stars are strictly for the staff, they were great. Didn't want to stay for dessert, so no opinion on that.\n",

It didn't look all that appetizing at first but it was quite good. Monchong is a very delicate fish and when prepared as it was is a bit mushy for my taste.

Ordered the veggies and hummus as an appetizer and they were fresh and crispy and the house made hummus was addicting. I wasn't a huge fan of the caper berries but others in my party enjoyed them. We ordered the fish tacos which lived up to their title as Maui's BEST! We took a piece of Hula pie to go as we were staying nearby and wanted to enjoy it later with some coffee, it was outstanding even though it was slightly melted when we got to eat it. We are planning to visit again later this trip! The service was pleasant and our server Danielle checked on us often. Reasonably priced for being on Maui and definitely worth it!\n",

I made a resie a month in advance having learned the hard way before. The table we were seated at was right on the railing overlooking the water and post sunset. This was the best part of the meal. The server was extremely odd, he wouldn't make eye contact with us when he spoke, very inattentive and down right weird. We ordered the poke to start, it was delish! My niece orders the monchong and I had the Ono. My fished was extremely overcooked and hard as a rock. My nieces fish was cooked perfectly. I tried to find my waiter for 15 mins to send my fish back. He finally came by and I told him I was bummed about my fish. He didn't say a word and literally took my plate and walked away??? He didn't offer me a new plate or anything else. Come to find out later he removed the fish from our bill. I think he should have offered me a choice. I settled on hula pie for dinner dessert since my fish was swooped up from me. Hula pie is awesome and a must order. Overall if you ate staying nearby then this place will work. It's not a destination if you ate staying elsewhere..

One of the best things about this restaurant is the view from upstairs. My husband and I ordered the fish and chips. We both thought the fish was fried to long.  We had two small pieces of fish some fries. It was served with a delicious coleslaw with cilantro. I left feeling like we shouldn't have paid 17.95 each for the amount of food received. My kids ordered beach burgers, they came with fries and were 14.95 each. The drinks were 3.25 each. Our waitress was friendly and kept our drinks filled, checked in with us, etc.  We spent 82 bucks (not including tip)on a mediocre lunch.  I think we will skip this place on our next trip to Maui.

Food was great, drinks were perfectly tropical and the staff was super attentive.

They said it wasn't guaranteed but turns out we got the best seat in the house. I do recommend you sit on the outer most table because it felt a little stuffy further in the restaurant.

      "By far the best restaurant experience yet on Maui. You can either dine in the actual restaurant or eat at the beachside grill. If you want to dine in, you need a reservation. If you do beachside, it's walk in only and when I called she said the sweet spot is between 5 and 5:30 when happy hour is ending. We took her advice and arrived at 5:15 and only waited 10-15 minutes. Not long after, the wait was incredibly long. The location is absolutely gorgeous and the view from the patio is perfect. We started with the sashimi and the chilled Thai shrimp appetizer and both were wonderful. This place is rated (for at least the last couple years) as the best fish tacos on Maui so we had to try them and it didn't disappoint. The tacos are served with very large pieces of fish perfectly seasoned and grilled. Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Maui.\n",

Best recommendation because the fish tacos were so freaking good and the hula pie was fantastic. We also tried the Kahlua pork Cuban sandwich which was just as delicious. When ordering drinks, I tried the Lava Flow (yum yum yummy!) and he had a classic Mai Tai (haf plenty of rum but he was expecting more sweetness).We didn't get there until right at the end of sunset so we couldn't really see the ocean but the ambiance with the tiki torches was perfect.

      "I love this place.  First of all, I've always had a great experience.  Secondly, the island drinks are awesome and more options than your standard lava flow and mai tai.  Third, the restaurant has a beach front grill for faster and cheaper food options.  Plus they have a standard restaurant with better options for steak and fish.  Both menus are good.  And you just can't deny the Kimo's Hula Pie being served here.  If you're staying on Ka'anapali it's nice to get this island treat without having to go to Lahaina.  If you've ever been to a Duke's on the mainland, you probably know what pie I'm talking about.  Mmm mmm!\n",

Had great convos and she also gave us a slice of the Hula pie on the house since we mentioned we just got married. I order the Filet mingon & the mister got the teriyaki steak. Both were delish! We were a little skeptical since we were in Hawaii and of course wanted to overload on as much Hawaiian food we could of.

When the person who came out to deliver the food he never asked who had ordered the medium and as luck would have it I got the dry one and our friend got the other.  We had already taken a bite from each plate so they redid the dish.  Our spouses ate their dinner while we waited.  What a night, especially on your 40th anniversary!  Now my husband had the Piaya dish, he ate but would never recommend it, so far off what it should be.  The waiter wasn't friendly, we asked for the manager to explain our disappoint and he said he would look into it and get back to us.

      "To start, the restaurant was super loud because they had their performers hooked up to big speakers in what amounted to quite an intimate setting (outdoor porch with not too many patrons). It made it such that it was almost impossible to maintain conversation and seemed a bit silly considering the size of the space and the number of people in the restaurant.\n",

      "The fish tacos I ordered were meh to okay. The fish was semi-fishy and was just plopped on the other layers of the taco, almost as an afterthought. This next point is a bit picky (and definitely personal preference based), but they used flour tortillas for the tacos instead of corn and I thought that the taste sometimes overpowered the other flavors in the taco. Also, I asked for no cheese on my tacos (it didn't really seem to make sense with the flavors) and they came with cheese. Womp womp.\n",

Okay, now, I could seriously eat these tacos EVERY day...and we did eat there a second time later in the week. Portions were huge, my husband and I split one order which was one taco apiece. It was plenty, order it with the homemade guacamole, you'll love the cool hit it gives the spicy fish.  Next time we're in Lahaina, this is the first meal I'll eat!\n",

Service was friendly, but entrees took a while to come. We had crab cakes w tomatillo aioli, which were decent. Fish chowder was similar to New England clam chowder, but a bit too thick for my taste. My 5 yo kid loved it though. I had the baby back ribs, which were tender and tasty. It came with sweet potato mash and Asian slaw. Portion size was generous.  My dinner partner had shrimp scampi, 4 big shrimps on fettuccine with white cream sauce. Two colors of pasta. This was decent, but not spectacular, especially compared to the fresh made pasta at Maui Fish and Pasta the night before.\n",

The problem I had was that if you're going to have two tacos for $16.00, I expect them to be phenomenal.  The soft shell wasn't crisp or even warmed,  and the toppings were sparse.  My wife's $11.00 \"loaded\" nachos consisted of chips with plenty of melted cheese,  and light sprinkles of the rest.  She added chicken for $4.00, and got about seven tiny chopped pieces (see attached photo). We each got one beverage.  Our lunch total was over $50.00 and we left feeling extremely unsatisfied.

It is situated in an AMAZING location on the beach and it is easy to get to if you are staying at one of the properties on Kaanapali.  We had eaten dinner at a place just across the courtyard from Leilani's and found their food to be almost identical but Leilani's was MUCH more costly.  At Leilani's we ate at the dinner place upstairs (not downstairs where the cost is slightly lower for some odd reason).  I had the steak which was very good quality but the person I went with had the Seafood Paella and it was a very small portion and was as costly as my fillet was.  Overall, it gets a 'meh'.

Multiple of us in the group have previously worked at restaurants/currently work in a restaurant so we understand and know how difficult it can be to serve such a large group.  Our servers name was David and from the very beginning he was very rude, disrespectful and arrogant.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he greeted our table instead of welcoming us all he asked \"how many more of us would be coming?\"  We in turn let him know there were 4 more and the staff was able to accommodate (originally it was a party of 14 so now up to 18) and you could tell he was irritated that there were more guests in the group.  Upon providing the table with napkins and silverware we kindly said \"whenever you are ready we'll go ahead and place our drink order\"  David's response was \"Pretty sure we've all been to a restaurant before and know how things work!?!\" which we were all incredibly taken back by!\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally our drink order was taken where we asked for waters for the table (only of which half were provided and without refills the entire visit) and some soda/alcoholic beverages.  Additionally we ordered two appetizers at the time of our drink order knowing that the food order would take a while being that we were in a large party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our appetizers came out prior to our specialty drinks did - which was strange because that should never happen, but we let it slide.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after, he took the tables order - between the time our order was placed and the food was delivered we did not see our server once.  Finally our food was delivered about 30 minutes or so after the order was placed, one or two of the plates were missing and took about another 5-10 minutes to get them to the table - by that time half if not all of us were close to finishing so we asked the waiter to please prepare the bill and drop it at his earliest opportunity as we were in a rush to make a catamaran boat cruise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Again, David made another crude remark saying \"Yeah someone on the other end of the table just asked for it, I will get it to you as soon as I separate it into your two checks (9 and 9 - by the tables - which we asked at the very beginning of the meal if that was ok and he agreed)\"  Since I was all the way at the opposite end of the table, I clearly did not hear the other guest in our party ask for the bill so I simply apologized and said \"Sorry I didn't realize someone had already asked...\" and he rudly interrupted me and said \"yeah they did and I will get it to you after I drop these dishes off\" - it was very off standing and made us feel that he was just working our table for the guaranteed 18% service charge that was added to the party.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dropped the bill and we paid and then left the restaurant to attend our boat excursion.  Upon us leaving we heard him tell one of the other waiters that we were \"a-holes\" and \"you're glad you didn't take that table\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While the men in our group were waiting for the women to finish getting ready for the boat cruise one of them called and spoke with the manager on Saturday.  They assured us that David is one of your best servers and that he may have just had an \"off day\" we re-iterated the story I just wrote above and the manager provided us with a $75 promotional credit to come back and have drinks or food.  The manager was great and extremely attentive - they listened, addressed the problem, provided a solution and assured overall happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "10 of us decided to give Lelani's another shot after speaking with the manager - we came in Sunday the 30th to get drinks at the bar and were greeted by your manager on duty - I think his name was Andrew? I am not sure.  He was INCREDIBLY accommodating and extremely apologetic. He assured us that this time our service would be above par and how service typically is.  We thought great!  So went to the bar where Johnny was our Bartender and he too was phenomenal - very accommodating and went out of his way to make sure we had a great time.  We were very happy upon heading to our evening dinner reservation at Hula Grill.  We closed out our tab - which Johnny ended up comp'ing for us (was $80 and we had a $75 credit - and we gave him a generous $40 tip) and headed over to dinner.  Ended up we sat outside and some of the tables were not covered so two of the men in our group came back to Lelani's to see if we could get a table that was covered and have dinner there. \n",
      "\n",

It also makes it a nice restaurant to relax in and catch the sunset while eating a delicious and fancier dinner entrée.  \n",

For lunch, we had kale salad, sriracha-guava chicken wings, and fish tacos.  And for dinner we had crispy maui onion crusted wahoo on a bed of rice with brussel sprouts and a creamy gouda sauce. Also a grilled Salmon Creek Farm pork chop with a chimichurri sauce and  whipped sweet potato and market veggies.  I would be excited to eat any of this food again. It was all excellent. \n",

Depending on the drink (beer, wine, well, or margarita) it's $5-$8 which is pretty standard for Kaanapali so I'm not complaining so much about that. But their appetizer/food choices: a la cart fish or chicken (?) tacos $5/ea (and they're tiny) OR Chips and salsa for I believe $5 as well. Yup that's it. 2 items!! Why bother with a happy hour?

Fresh salsa on the side had no bite or flavor at all. Sad that I didn't order that burger!! Also highly suggested was the hula pie. Huge slice of pie to share, but I could tell it had spent way too much time in the freezer. Ice cream was crystallized & grainy. I realize their menu is geared for the masses (tourists).

In their defense, it was no longer mooing, but the inside was still far too reminiscent of an open wound for me to want anything to do with it.

      "Just dropped in at Hula Grill for quick lunch while in Lahaina (March 2018), stayed for an hour or so... The site is in a busy confluence of sidewalk, beach walk and at the back of Whalers Village. However it has a decent ocean view and hula vibe that when you finally get \"Island Time\" figured out - this place feeds it to some degree. Take it all in as you munch...good food and drink, music, endless flow of beach clad walkers peering in as you peer out. I love it! They usually have a local singer under the grass hut putting out Hawaiian fare. Our guy was great! The food and service manage to not get in the way of your mellow joy- that I like. Plus it's next to one of my favorites (Leilani's ) which was undergoing a renovation...\n",

It was supposed to have a spicy aioli but there was none and the avocados were way overripe. We had free potstickers from saving a receipt from a prior dinner. Also had free hula pie.

For dinner I had the 1/2 chicken while my wife and girls got the macadamia crusted halibut, ahi tacos and pot stickers. Everything was so delicious and had such great flavors. The chicken was probably one of the best meals I have had in a long time and I couldn't even finish it because of how generous the portions were. The smoky flavor was truly remarkable and although I shouldn't have I had to sneak a bite of the halibut and this as well  was so delicious. That was fine because my youngest enjoyed feeding one of the stray cats that hang around some of our leftovers. These cats just hang around and I don't blame them waiting on people like us to feed them. At first I was a little apprehensive but they are really domesticated and almost look like a Siamese breed that somehow got here. Either way even though I really wanted desert there was no physical way I could eat anymore.

      "FINE DINING SIDE - So it is important to know that there are 2 sides to Hula Grill this review is for the fine dining side.  I only gave the casual side 3 stars  in a previous review. So first of all are excellent and that our service in the fine dining side was excellent! Eve was fabulous! The food was great and although some of the menu items were the same the service was just so wonderful and the items we ordered here made it 5  The shrimp scampi was excellent and my husband says it was one of the best items he had in Maui. The kale salad was also so good he wanted more. My crab topped macadamia nut crusted mahi-mahi was very flavorful of a little light on the crab . My son loved his fire grilled ahi steak dish. The hula pie is so good it literally makes you want to hula . Excellent end to the meal. Mahalo everyone!!\n",

Nonetheless, I still love the lively atmosphere and the live music at the beach bar on the first floor.  They usually have a live band and on some nights a hula dancer.  The beach front location, seating in the sand and island music will instantly put you in the aloha spirit.\n",

I wanted to order one grilled and one fried taco but was informed by the waiter that the orders are \"premade\" and the request was impossible to fulfill, which left me questioning the freshness of the food.  I had the grilled tacos which came out fine except for a slightly stale tortilla.  The other dishes I tried, including the kalua pork flatbread, pork sandwich, short rib tacos and crab wontons were all pretty standard.  The drinks are also decently prepared and will satisfy any craving for island libations.\n",

In fact while asking questions about the ceviche that they had, another guest at the table text to us whispered that it was not good and advised us to avoid it. I ordered the Ahi tacos and was quite disappointed. They placed the small tacos on some guacamole and drizzled the taco with aioli. By the time the tacos got to my table. They were quite soggy and not tasty. After you eat the tacos you're left with 3 ice cream scoops of guacamole  and have nothing to eat it with. The service was ok, the wait for food was over 30 min.

The setting was beautiful and I expected to have a nice lunch with my wife and friends as we had a very good experience at the Hula grill in Oahu. Unfortunately our sever was terrible, messed up both my wife and I's orders as well as one of my friends. I was told the Loco Moco short rib special could be made gluten free, however they just left the gravy off (I had clarified that gravy was included when I ordered) and I was left with dried out short rib meat. Totally bland, oh and no salt or pepper on the table. I sent it back and ordered the shrimp and grits. It wasn't bad, but the shrimp tasted like they had been frozen and I only received 3 medium sized shrimp. Barely a meal. I was never asked if I wanted a refill on my iced tea, no water refills until we asked at the end of the meal. A friend ordered a Mai Tai that she waited 15+ minutes for, canceled while waiting for our bill and when it arrived was all sweaty and all the ice had melted. And after we had asked for our bill our waiter started taking orders while we continued to wait. There are several other restaurants that are much better in the area, pass on the Hula grill.\n",

By the time we finished our first 2 plates, the server informed us that the kitchen was closing and if we wanted to order more, we needed to now. We were still missing 4 of our items and my daughters food. The rest of our appetizers came out and still no kids chicken dish. After almost 50 minutes, we got her dinner. It was now 945 and she was literally asleep at the table. So, as mixed reviews go, the server and kitchen were way off, but the food was amazing. The corn with the sauce was outstanding. \n",

For dinner I had the New York strip and it was awesome. They grill it and it's infused with a bit of smoke from a local hardwood and one of the best steaks from a restaurant I have had in years. My wife had the Shrimp Carbonara which I had to to try and of course it was amazing too pasta seemed fresh and homemade shrimp were large and flavorful and the pasta was almost creamy.

      "The food is good.  Not great.  I love the location as we stayed in Kaanapali and it was walking distance from the Sheraton.  Prices are high and i feel like the quality of the food does not match.  Some things were solid good and some things were just okay.  Can't even comment on what we ate becuase it was over a week ago and the food was not memorable.  Cocktails are pretty sweet and kids meals are pricey (typical Hawaii expensive).  I felt like it was touristy, but also what can you expect from a beachfront Whaler's Village restaurant.  If you want to take your family out to a nice meal in Kaanapali this is one choice.  You can go casual or a little dressed up.  Nice view at sunset as it's right on the beach.\n",

Local dairy Surfing Goat supplied the goat cheese.\n",

However, the waiter said they sold out of the A'u, so they had to substitute another similar fish.... I think the waiter said it was a sailfish of some type, so I assume it was Pacific Sailfish, but they are supposedly pretty rare to catch, so who knows what I ate!  Anyway, it was amazing... best prepared fish I have ever had.  The accompanying parts of the dish were perfect... veggies and quinoa and some sort of local fruit compote that went perfectly with the slightly smokey grilled fish.  The in-house \"firewater\" sauce is superb as well.\n",

My son had a kid's quesadilla ($7 and tiny). We all shared a hula pie and the waitress surprised me with a special bday dessert. SO YUMMY!\n",

      "My wife and I picked this spot in the Whalers Village shopping center located on the beach in resort row (near the Westin) in Ka'anapali. We had about a 15-20 minute wait on a Monday night but I'd wait 30 minutes plus to dine here again. Excellent bar and wait staff, nice Hawaiian live music (even on a Monday night!), and the food was awesome. Starts with some nice focaccia style bread with a sweet pepper sauce to drizzle along with olive oil for dipping, but save room for the main fare. Shrimp cocktail appetizer was also very good. Five tiger shrimp with a house cocktail sauce that is a bit sweeter than your standard. I had the Ahi main entree with a nice smoky Asian noodle side. The ahi cuts like butter and melts in your mouth. My wife had the house special combination of two fish. Swordfish and a type of white fish with a lobster bisque sauce. Side of jasmine rice and sautéed veggies. Absolutely delicious! This is a must stop for dining if you are looking for something a little more than standard beach dining in a resort heavy area. Best of all, the prices are competitive with much lower quality offerings in the same area.\n",

They have a pager system so you can relax at the (quite nice) bar while awaiting your table. It's not cheap, but compared to the overpriced, forgettable resort food in the area it's not unreasonable at all.\n",

      "So disappointed. Flew in and checked into our room. Starving found out this place is a 5 minute walk away and recommended. Confusing restaurant divided into 3 parts. It was suggested we sit in the barefoot bar portion to enjoy both menus. Shone to the only table in the blaring sun. Asked may we please have one not in the sun. Guy says yes and leaves us standing there in the sand. We just pick a table and sit. After the big ordeal that we must check in and be seated. Ordered a Mai Tai, iced tea, appetizers, salad from one menu and burgers from the other.  Mai Tia was weak and not very flavorful. This is my 2nd week in Hawaii and I've had some good Mai Tais, but not here.  Iced tea warm almost like it was just brewed and no ice. My salad came at the time they said it would ate it and enjoyed it. Then after another 20 minute wait our dinner came. Where's the appetizers?  Well we don't want them now. No problem we'll comp them please keep the fruit plate. Burgers were adequate. No complaints.  Appetizers come. Servers says \"Dude you have your dinners?!  Bad timing in the kitchen sorry about that.  Do you still want them?\"  We said leave the fruit, because waitress said she'd comp it. No she didn't. By now you've worn us down. We're tired, still hungry and just want to leave. We were told Leilani's next door is ruined by same company. Two restaurants knocked out at once. Won't be going there.\n",

When we arrived there were eight of us.  We had attempted to make reservations and were told they don't accept reservations, yet I read someone else had them. We were told we could eat inside for a wait of 20 to 30 minutes or in the sand for over an hour wait.  With 4 kids we took the lesser wait. Once seated we waited 34 minutes before placing our order.  Because we were inside, we couldn't get any of the meals on the outside menu. One of our party wanted a hamburger and that was out. I had the salad that was warm wilted lettuce.  I had asked for dressing on the side and didn't get it.  This place is for people who are staying in hotels and are in Maui for a week and maybe on their first trip. Or, maybe they are people who eat at fast food restaurants the rest of the year.  It is definitely not a 4 or 5 star restaurant.  Service very slow.\n",

Table was set up with a nice card that I regrettably forgot to grab on the way out. Three people stopped by to wish us happy anniversary and since I was so upset about the boat ride it was extra nice. Food was amazing. The yummy bread and dipping sauce was legit.

For as beautiful as the island is, it is hard to find a good meal for a reasonable price. Every time we come to Maui, we eat outside at the barefoot bar at the Hula Grill about 3-4 times. I'd suggest the goatcheese flatbread pizza, fish tacos, or pineapple upside down cake. Absolutely delicious. Also, the atmosphere here can't be beat. Amazing location.

We opted to sit inside at the bar to have the option of both the fine dining menu and the bar menu.  We didn't have the view of the outdoors but I liked seeing the inner workings of the kitchen and watching the food being expedited.  We started with the Kahlua pig potstickers, nicely crunchy and chock full of pork.  The sauce was your typical soy sauce dipping sauce, nothing too great, had a little bit of sesame oil.  The complimentary focaccia was very good, and I loved the spicy citrus vinegar and olive oil, that was the highlight of the night honestly.  My husband had the macadamia nut crusted Mahi Mahi and again, after Mama's it's hard to compete.  He thought the crab was overly sweet and it overwhelmed the dish.  The rice and slaw were just average.  I had the Tandori monchang, the flavor was good, a little overwhelming and again the rice and cucumber raita was just average.  I was expecting a yogurt based cucumber raita to cut through the spicy Tandori glaze but it was more of a cucumber salad.  Overall it was good, but not great for the prices : /.\n",

He was very personable, knew his restaurant and employees, friendly with the entire table, and was very down to earth.  Would love to have him as a server, but understand by our conversation he was a manager.  A very well run restaurant.  Food was also terrific and fresh!

We had to leave our table of 20 people to go to the bar and get our own drinks because our server was doing who knows what.  When he did walk by our table he wouldn't even look in our direction.  I approached a manager about how unhappy we were after two hours! And we had still not even received our first course, and half of my party had empty drink glasses.  He said \" oh I'm sorry\", and that's it nothing was done.  I will never recommend this place to anyone or eat there again.  In all for a two course meal with drinks we were there for 3 and a half hours, the last 45 min was just waiting to get a bill and some boxes.  What has happened to good customer service?\n",

Our biggest problem though is after their recent menu redesign, they removed the only vegetarian dish our kids loved (the squash ravioli). On a 7-day vacation, even kids get sick of eating grilled cheese, you know? We are Hindu vegetarians, a family of 6, and this is a constant problem in Hawaii. Even potentially good things like risotto are off limits here because of the use of beef stock. Hawaii attracts people from both sides of the pacific, from many cultures, yet they still seem to cater to the Midwestern tastes (hula grill included). It's sad.  There is ONE adult vegetarian dish, but we had to beg and argue special exception to get the other veggie item off the \"tasting menu\" given to us as an entree. Otherwise we would have all been eating the same thing. \n",

This place was packed, mostly because of their location, and they should be used to this night in and night out. After being seated we waited about 5 minutes for water and another 10 minutes before our server asked to take a drink order. He brought us some cold bread that was suppose to be warm because you could see condensation on the tin basket. We watched as the server chatted up some guests only after the bill arrived, the typical \"where you from?\" table after table before finally taking our order. The fish we ordered was okay at best (for the expensive prices we expected much more) and it was as cold as the bread. The server only talked to us or asked how the food was, you guessed it, when he brought us our bill.

Little overpriced but I guess you're paying for the atmosphere and location. There are two sections to eat at, the grill (burgers, fries, etc) and the dinner section. We ate at the dinner section and had the goat cheese salad and the macadamia crusted Hawaiian sea bass and the wood grilled white fish. I'd macadamia crusted fish was delicious, I just wish they put more of the sauce on the fish. Came with a side of cole slaw (blech) and jasmine rice. The wood grilled fish was nothing special.

Made a reservation and was seating at once at a perfect table.  2 children (ages 4 & 7) were treated like royalty and just can't say enough great things about our waiter, Spud.  He recommended perfect choices for both my husband and me as well as our children.  We decided to go with the 3 course benefit dinner which was great.  Our Mai Tai's were awesome as well.  Perfect ending to our long awaited trip to Maui.  Can't wait to go back....hopefully Spud will still be there!!!\n",

The food isn't cheap - you are paying for the view, as well as the fish - but it is fresh and flavorful. We ate here multiple times while staying at a nearby hotel, and all of the fish dishes my husband and I tried were great. The fish was always cooked to the right tenderness, and the flavoring (wood grilled, macadamia nut, etc.) was in good balance with the natural flavor of the fish. The standout dish for me, though, was the tandoori monchong. I have had tandoori mahi mahi before, but the monchong seems to be a much better fish for this preparation. The natural oiliness of the fish balanced out the drier tandoori flavors, and the raita that accompanied it added a good coolness to the overall balance. If the monchong is available tandoori-style (I believe they rotate what fish is served which way), then go for it! The kids menu had some of the basic dishes you find for kids everywhere, but it also had a nice fresh fish option, which came in a mild butter/cream sauce. My kids loved it.\n",

(Maui isn't typically known for its New York and San Francisco-type late spots.) \n",
      "\n",
      "We saw Hula Grill listed in a tourist booklet when we checked in at the front desk of the condo and then looked it up on Yelp! It had great reviews (a few mixed on the service), though decided to try it since it was open til 11pm. \n",
      "\n",
      "*One thing to remember while in Hawaii especially... follow the advice of fellow Yelpers. They will not steer you wrong. We made that mistake a couple of times the first time we were here and will NEVER do it again.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we got to Hula Grill, they seated us at a nice, outdoor table right away and then we waited. It was several minutes before anyone approached us with menus, but after that, things were fine. \n",
      "We ordered the Poke Tacos (ahi tuna with onions, sesame seeds, sprouts with a delicious sauce inside a fried wonton taco). Three tacos come in an order. Instead of fighting for the 3rd taco, I took a big bite and my husband had the rest. These are unbelievable! It's hard to place exactly what the marinade of the fish is but definitely soy, ginger and something. \n",
      "\n",
      "For Dinner, I had the Ahi Tuna steak - a generous portion of ahi seared on the outside and raw inside. It's fantastic! Served with wild rice and a pineapple slaw that contains no mayo! Awesome. \n",
      "\n",
      "My husband has the special that night - Mahi Mahi AND Ono. The ono melted in your mouth and the Mahi had great flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great food here. One bit of caution however, although cocktails are not super expensive, they are also not good. I had a lemon drop that was like drinking straight lemon juice. My husband had a jack and coke that had zero fizz and kind of tasted like syrup. If you're going to enjoy an adult beverage here, stick with wine or beer. Hard for the bartender to screw that up.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, Hula Grill is about as good as food gets so save up about $80-$100 for 2 ppl and hit this place up with no delay.\n",

It took a while to figure out how things worked because some servers didn't know how it works, but when we found the right server, they directed us to the right spot.  \n",

We waited there for 10 minutes, luckily, there were people who were leaving.  We sat down and learned that this included appetizer, main course and a dessert.  We weren't sure how it was gonna taste like, but watching the chefs make the food... it looked good.  \n",
      "I don't quite remember what we ordered since this is a very late review.  The only thing I remembered was how juicy our steak was.  We had good appetizers and even the dessert was yum.  It was in a smaller side, but it was still filling!  For $24.95, it was a great deal.  It was a splurge that didn't feel like a splurge in our wallet!  Don't regret this at all and I recommend folks to take advantage of this.  Yum!\n",

My sister and I picked Hula Grill over Leilani's because they had more salad selections on their menu.  We got there at 330pm so it was still very hot outside.  I wished we were in the AC dining area but we endured it.  Eventually, the island breeze came through the area.  The solo guitarist played wonderful music to add to the ambiance of the barefoot dining experience.  I ordered a Plantation Lemonade off their happy hour drink menu and I wouldn't suggest that drink to anyone.  It simply tasted like pink lemonade to me.  Our waitress was excellent.  My sister ordered the the Hula Caesar with a nice size but not so good cut of seared ahi.  I ordered the Shrimp, Spinach, & Asian Pear salad.  It comes with beets which is not mentioned in the menu so if you don't want beets, let them know.  The shrimp weren't itty bitty so I was impressed.  The spinach and asian pear were probably not local so you're not paying for freshness but for the \"experience\".  Maui sunset, live entertainment, and outdoor eating with great company...what more can you ask for?\n",

The burger comes on a ciabata roll which isn't very inventive if you ask me.  It was also overpowered by some blue maytag cheese that had I ordered this dish again would have passed on for a dash of mayo.  Also SALT is the key to bringing out the flavor of ground beef and it amazes me that so many restaurants haven't figured this out yet.  What do you think they sprinkle on the patties as IN-N-OUT?

Best Mai tais on the Island! The staff was excellent and so very easy to work with...even from Oklahoma. Everything ran right on schedule..all of our needs were met beyond expectation.

Early in the day we had phoned Dukes looking to watch the UFC fights, we were told they would be happy to put them on their television.   A group of 5 of us went to the bar and had drinks for an hour and half and watched the UFC fights.  One minute into the main even,  a man we had not seen before walked in and changed the channel.  My brother asked  \"it's the main event why are you changing the channel.\" the manager Patrick - very rudely said this is a family bar- UFC is not allowed.  Blood and fights with kids. We do not allow this.   You can watch the dodgers.  Now if this is a rule- understood.  However- why doesn't Patrick educate his staff to this?  There were much better ways to communicate to our group. His tone was condescending   and after he changed the channel he turned his back on our group and walked off.  His bartenders were great and suggested several other places we could try- but it was too late to go anywhere else.  Patrick learn from your staff!\n",

I usually split the macadamia nut crusted fish with my wife, and Duke's split it for us. (I really like when places split a dish on 2 plates for you instead of you having to do it). I will say one dish I ordered that I did not care for at all was the fish and chips. Captain D's makes a better fish and chips. So stay away from that. Breakfast was fine. Wife had breakfast burrito that she liked and u had the khalua pork sandwich, I thought was ok not my favorite. The thing though that you must get to eat here is the Hula pie. Now that was phenomenal. So don't skip the dessert. Plus another plus is that you can make reservations on open table.\n",

      "It's a great location .. we had pretty good service too. Atmosphere is perfect with ocean views, Hawaiian feel and live music playing. We were there just before and at sunset and a nice, short walk back to our hotel. We had 13 of us and most of us liked the food - everyone who had fish was very happy and satisfied. I think food presentation could be better. The sweet, purple bread rolls are super yummy. I had the vegetarian dish which was a poor choice on my part - and it wasn't too good and costs more than it should have. They topped it off with 3 delicious ice cream desserts to help us celebrate my husband's birthday. It was so nice and generous of them and great way to end the dinner.\n",

They didn't have any open tables in their \"serving area\", but there was about 20 tables right beside them that they claimed were reserved for dinner at 5:00, which was 2 hours away from when we first arrived. They told us the wait for another table would be 40 minutes, because they had to start setting up those open tables for dinner (??). Anyways, an hour had gone by and we still waited, there was not enough room on the bench for us so one member sat at one of those empty tables to wait and was asked by a waiter to not sit there (when the tables were still not set up for dinner like they claimed they needed to do). Spoke to the manager and didn't offer much reasoning.  Only good part was he asked a table to leave after they were hanging for a long time. Our waiter was amazing tho, props to him.\n",

      "Yo I went to this place last night n was expecting some bomb, shcrumptious food. My friend ordered some chicken n potatoes and I couldn't understand what half of the menu said so I just got the calamari and shrimp. My other friend orders the monchong with rice (monchong is the best fish don't @ me) Food comes out I'm thinking ight looked fancy but then it hit my mouth. Shrimp was cool but 15 bucks for 4 pieces (to be expected when going here). I finished within a cool minute n my friend is scrunchin her face up. So I'm like ight what's the deal with her food, I taste it and it's like they've never had a potatoe in the kitchen before. The mashed potatoes tasted like mayo. Who puts mayo in potatoes. The chicken had no seasoning like white peoples meat at a barbecue. My friends fish was cool (it was monchong u cant mess that up) but the rice was confusing my noggin cap. These places in Hawaii seem to overthink the simplest things. Rice. Just rice. You ain't have to do that to my rice my man. They drenched it in vegies blood cus it was stained green. Ruined it. I would've gave u an extra star for white rice but u done messed up. Dessert was cool, got the hula pie. Got a coffee that was so strong went straight to my head n gave me a fat ole headache.

      "There are many wonderful places to dine on Maui and we chose Dukes for our Mother's Day celebration!  Sadly it was the wrong decision, and we will not be returning.  We have dined at several other T S restaurants, including other Dukes and have had experiences that were truly memorable.  Dukes Maui will be remembered in a negative way.  The service and food lacked consistency and both left something to be desired.  When we arrived we checked in at the host desk and waited at least a minute to be acknowledged by the hostess.  We were put on a 10-15 minute wait when there were several open tables.  When we were being seated the hostess was handing out roses, which was a very thoughtful gesture.  However, they neglected to notice there were two mothers in our group.  When seated we were given two place settings instead of four.  When our server arrived he quickly introduced himself and said he would let us look over the menu.  He never offered drinks, appetizers, or entree selections.  When he returned he asked if we were ready to order.  I asked a question about modifying an item for a dairy sensitivity and his response was \"no\".  I sat in silence for a moment in shock at his response with no explanation or suggestions for an alternative entree.  When I asked why I could not modify he said because of the tortilla(which doesn't contain dairy), I then asked if he could suggest something.  Being non-observant that I was interested in a brunch item he suggested something off of the lunch menu and ironically had tortilla as a main component.  His tone was rude, short and unaccommodating. Because I couldn't decide on an alternative and basically didn't trust his suggestions, I said I would need a moment, he simply said he would be back.  When he returned he asked if we were ready(again rude tone).  Instead of selling me on an entree that was $15-$20, I ended up deciding on oatmeal that was $6.00.  Bad salesmanship.  When I ordered the oatmeal he said \"so no milk\", which wasn't even listed on the menu as an ingredient.  After he took our order he was about to walk way when I asked if we could order beverages.  Seeing I was looking at the menu for a drink list, and unsuccessful at that, our server just stood there again with no suggestions.  I had to ask for a drink menu.  I'm sure it's part of their service standards to suggestive sell/offer specifics.  Our food seemed to take a long time, when it arrived we had to ask for place settings.  We also had to demand attention from our server to get condiments, and beverage refills.  Which should not have been an issue had he preset our table with condiments and checked on us when we received our meal.  Both my husband and mother in law ordered French toast, they were dry and burnt on the bottom.  My oatmeal was mediocre, but I didn't have high expectations for it, and at this point I basically lost my appetite.  I would have shared this experience with a manager had one been present.  Dukes has an overall good reputation, it's unfortunate that they employ team members that feel it's expectable to give the horrible service we received on our visit.\n",

      "Stayed in Maui for 10days. Ate at Dukes 4x. I'll start with the appetizers. Had three different ones. The first was the cerviche. Delicious. Made from striped marlin, perfect texture and blend with a mild type of pepper. A step away from the typical cerviche. The crab cakes were among the best I have had. They are almost in the same league with AJ Maxwell's in Manhattan. Of course, what you will find on every menu in Maui are coconut shrimp. These are deep fried shrimp balls with a delicate and fabulous breading with tender chunks of prawns inside. If there is any criticism to give, the Mai Tai was good, but not memorable. The same could be said for the cheeseburger with blue cheese. Very good, but wasn't really any better than anyone else's.  When you combine location, quality and service Dukes is a sure thing.\n",

Our dining visit to Dukes Beach House came upon recommendation from friends who had eaten there in the past.  Let's just say their recommendation was not unfounded!\n",

      "I am a server myself and have been in the food and beverage industry for nearly 20 years.  Because of which, people in the industry often have the tendency of being hypercritical when they dine out.  With that being said, our waiter and Dukes Beach House has their stuff together!\n",
      "\n",
      "The day before we left the island we decided to make Dukes our going away dinner spot.  We arrived at the restaurant on July 20, 2016 at 8 pm.  Hostess graciously greeted us and told us that it will only be a 5 min wait for our table as they were still getting it cleaned and set up.  Less than 5 min later she politely escorted us to our table.  The restaurant is located right on the beach and the tables are spread out just enough to not bump into other parties dining and makes it very inviting.  Once sat we were approached by the back waiter/busser and given a water option of bottled water or tap.  We choose tap water.  A moment later we were approached by our server who introduced himself as Andy (Andrew).  He was very polite, asked if we have ever been here before, asked where we were from, and asked if he could walk us through the menu and suggest some items to us.  We said sure, and he let us know about the island fish special they were serving, highlighted some of their best apps, popular entrees, and touched on the wine list, also letting us know that he can make some bottle suggestions based on what we order for the perfect pairing.  Being a server myself, this was a giant red flag for me that this gentleman knew how to do his job and do it well!  I really liked that based on other types of service we have had on the island before our visit to Dukes.  Water glasses were filled for us, and Andy suggested some delicious virgin lava flows for my girls, which they really loved.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Based on Andys suggestion, we started with the calamari, the wontons, and the blackened sashimi for the table.  I also ordered the shrimp cocktail for myself.  We also went with a bottle of Dr. Loosen Riesling because it's actually one of my favorite wines, and a good pairing wine that Andy suggested.  The wontons were filled with crab meat, the calamari were like calamari sticks with cocktail sauce and a roumalade of some kind, and the sashimi was also served on top of a vegetable soy bean medley.  All apps were enjoyed by the table as we pretty much finished them all!  My shrimp cocktail came with 5 pieces of gulf shrimp and a side of cocktail sauce.  Let's just say Dukes doesn't mess around with their cocktail sauce as it is quite spicy but so delicious!  Had to hit the water a few times but went back for more!\n",
      "\n",
      "For entrees the kids went with a burger and chicken nuggets, I went with the Filet and lobster tail add on, my friend went with the Opakapaka Fish Special that Andy suggested, and his girlfriend chose the Citrus Jidori Roasted Chicken Breast.  All meals were delicious, tender, and everyone pretty much finished their plates with the exception of my filet meal.  I ate the filet and lobster completely (filet basically melted in my mouth) but I didn't have enough room left to finish the mashed potatoes and corn that it also came with.  After the apps, I was almost full, but I would never waste a good filet!  My friend also let me try his Opakapaka Fish and it had to be the best flavored fish I ever ate.  Almost wished I had chose that instead.  But perhaps next time.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Since we were all pretty much full, we decided to just share one dessert.  Andy said the best thing to share and his favorite dessert on the menu was the Hula Cake.  He was not wrong!  My friend also ordered the 1/2 bottle of Domaine Serene to enjoy with dessert.  We all loved how light the dessert was, the nice touch of macadamia nuts in the dessert, just the right amount of chocolate and whip cream and the ice cream that holds it all together was light, citrus, and amazing!  The Pinot Noir paired nicely as well according to my friend.  I was still enjoying my Riesling.\n",

      "Heidi was our server and she was personable, friendly and accurate with our order despite there were 26 of us - 2 tables were set up for our party. The seating was cramped and the side I was sitting at was up against a post so my guests on each side of me had to get up whenever I excused myself from the table. We started off with appetizers - arugula salad with beets, poke, calamari and Korean ribs. The ribs were salty and I was surprised the poke was actually good. My cousins and I ordered different entrees from each other so it became a tasting session. I had the steamed fish and shrimp but overall I recommend the braised short ribs and seafood risotto with a glass of wine which was to die for. I wish I had order the risotto instead. For dessert, their Hula pie is what their popular for so we ordered one and about 10 of us shared it. It was perfect for the amount of sweetness after a big dinner.\n",

The service was pretty good. I was a little bummed that I asked for bread, that they bring out to every table, about 4 times before we eventually got it. Our meal was over at that point, but we still got some. And the bread was delicious! They then brought me some Hula Pie for my birthday desert which tasted pretty good.

The only reason I give this place 4 out of 5 stars instead of the full 5 star rating is: 1) How long it took to get and how many times i asked for some bread and 2) Stay away from the Hula Pie.

I certainly don't think they are sourcing local for most of their ingredients unfortunately. Fish tacos were very dry and not well spiced. Fish was pretty good but coconut rice had no flavor and the good but needed Better spice. Apps felt generic and as if they came from a freezer. Crab wontons were too cheesy and greasy. Tuna app had nasty heavy sweet potato chips that killed any fish flavor the fish was suppose to have. They actually took it off our bill because they saw we barely touched it. View was ok, but the kuai and Oahu locations have a better view for sure. Drinks were good, pricey though. Party of six with three pre teens that didn't drink, no wine ordered, $300 bill after tip.

They bring out Taro rolls in the beginning which are purple and a bit scary to those less adventurous eaters. They are SO good! We all loved them. I ordered the seafood risotto which has shrimp, lobster, mahi mahi, and scallops on it. I am not a fan of scallops or mahi mahi, so I asked our waitress if I could just have shrimp and lobster. The chef said no problem and I'm so glad he did! The risotto was perfect and so yummy. Best dish I've had in Maui. The rest of the table either had burgers, which were great, or the special which was a snapper dish (also great). The daiquiri was also yummy. Beautiful atmosphere and great service.

      "The food was just not good. We decided to eat here for dinner tonight, our last night in Maui. We previously dined at Duke's in Oahu so we wanted to save the best for last. First off, the waiter we had was very unfriendly and inattentive. He took our orders, disappeared,then would sporadically reappear every 20 min or so. Next, the food didn't taste good at all. The kids chicken tenders w/ fries we ordered for my 6 year old was greasy and way over-cooked. There was barely any chicken, just a hollow, burnt deep fried shell of crust. The fish tacos I ordered were absolutely bland and underwhelming. I've never had a fish taco filled with so much avocado. There was at least a half a slice of avocado in each of the two tacos I was served. The result was a mushy, bland concoction. It was more like an avocado taco with a sliver of fish in it. My husband said his burger was just ok, nothing ground-breaking. When we informed the waiter about my son's inedible meal he offered to have it remade but by then we were ready to go (we were there for almost two hours including wait time). To their credit the waiter did remove the kids meal from our tab though he mentioned no apology but rather silence when handing us the bill. Overall, I've lost my faith in this restaurant and won't be returning. If you want a good meal (or at least a decent FISH taco) you're better off going to Leilani's down the street.\n",

We were impressed by the quality, healthy options on the menu like the frekah salad and roasted brussel sprouts and many imaginative dishes, as well as imported German hefe-weisen beer on tap, rather than the same old options everywhere. We went back recently and found that everything had been reduced except the price. The menu was utterly unimaginative and the quality was greatly degraded. We were disappointed by everything we had. We went again with friends, simply because of the outstanding atmosphere and the fact that we had a gift certificate. We ordered a wide array of dishes, hoping that the previous time had simply been a fluke, but there wasn't one thing that anyone sampled that wan't disappointing. The seared sashimi was flavorless and sliced so thinly that you could see through it and wasn't even served with wasabi, the black bean nachos were a pile of chips fused with a blob of cheese and if there were beans, they were hard to find. There was no salsa and the avocado was the size of a ball of butter on the top. The beet and goat cheese salad was small and very short on beets and cheese. One person ordered the seafood paella which sounded fabulous and the price and description suggested a dish packed with seafood, but it came in a soup bowl with lots of paella and almost no seafood. She actually started laughing because she said needed more light to find something in it. I could go on, but it was truly disappointing. The two stars are for the service and ambience which is still excellent, but it has so much potential and had once been good, I hope they get their act together.\n",

Got drinks and purple Hawaiian King Sweet Bread. Then 30 minutes went by and nothing. Finally asked where the appetizers were. Came out 5 minutes later with lame excuse about a wedding party. Crappy, meager, poor presentation, and expensive appetizers. Calamari was weird, shrimp was a fried dough ball, and so so wonton.  Just crap! Then immediately our cold dinners arrived on hot plates. The kitchen must have replated the cold food hoping for the best. The fish was a lousy small cut, limp bok choy, and poorly seasoned rice all with too much salty soy. If I was not with others I would have rejected the whole mess and demand an apology from the manager for what was suppose to be a retirement celebration.  Feel like stopping payment on a 300 tab.

We didn't have a reservation but that didn't bother us even though we had to wait for about 45 minutes...hey we're on Maui time and the views sure did keep us busy. As soon as we were seated out waiter came and greeted us and showed us the cocktail list as well as the very impressive wine list. I decided to have a lava flow and my mom had a Pinot Grigio. My mom ordered their version of a Cesar salad and the coconut shrimp...I ordered the fish tacos. When our food came out we were both kindnofnperplexed as the coconut shrimp was 4 fried balls(not what you have in your mind when you order coconut shrimp) and the Cesar salad was all hard pieces of lettuce that was not edible. My fish tacos were very small and to be quite honest had no flavor(it was rather loaded with cilantro (which I'm not a big fan of) overall our meal was very disappointing. Our waiter never checked up on us either which is weird in a resort town. We definetely won't be back as there are so many other amazing restaurants in Maui. As we were walking out, we had stopped to purchase a tshirt for a friend and the girl who was at the register seemed to be bothered by us asking some basic questions about the tshirt. She actually turned her head and started a conversation with another hostess...as I stood there and locked eyes with her I said hello to get her attention again.

Out of all the entrees that we ordered the only thing that was remotely worth the cost was our daughters kid entree of fish and chips. The Mahi Mahi was so over cooked the fish crumbled and stuck to the roof of your mouth. The fish tacos were disappointing and overpriced like everything else, better off going to a taco cart. The waiter was standoffish and you could sense the disappointment in having to serve a family with small children, his attempt to up-sale on appetizers/salads was lackluster, over all he had zero panache. The only thing that wasn't disappointing was the hula pie, however after having such a meal any ice cream topped with fudge would be an improvement, and although it was good it really was nothing more than a slice of Dairy Queen ice cream cake. The most annoying thing of the evening is that our waiter tacked on the automatic 18% gratuity that is for parties of 8 or more....we had 7 in our party and 3 of them were under 4 years of age. Duke's you suck. Oh and although it was cloudy out they had the sun shades down the entire time we were eating, they finally rolled them up as we were signing the check it was then that we realized we just paid an exorbitant amount of money for a meal that didn't even have a nice view to distract us.\n",

      "This is embarrassing but we went to Dukes 3x on our short visit to Maui. We liked the food and view, plus it was the perfect 15-20 minute walk on the beach trail from our hotel so we felt like we were burning off some of the fat getting there and back. The first time was breakfast with my husband on our first day and it was SO good. Five stars. They have a fresh, local fruit platter and it was the best thing I'd ever had in my life.  I also got the baguette with my fruit and the sweet butter that came with it made it the perfect breakfast. My husband got the breakfast sandwich and while it was pretty messy, he said it was great. Second visit, my husband and I came back but missed breakfast so had lunch instead and there was a whale putting on a show right in front of the restaurant. You couldn't have paid for a better view. Beautiful. We got the black bean nachos and mango BBQ salad, both delish. So now we are raving over this place and bring the whole fam for breakfast on our last day. I'm legit going on and on about the fruit like there's crack in it. Apparently the fruit is whatever they have that day, which is super cool, but it wasn't nearly as amazing as the first day. I felt the need to include this in the review so no one thinks I'm insane for being so obsessed with the fruit if they get something sub-par. Everyone was happy with the food overall. \n",

Andrew made a great wine paring suggestion that made the meal even more enticing.\n",

Upon our arrival, the hostess greeted us with a cheerful \"Aloha\" and \"Congratulations!\"  From then on, our experience was about as good as it can get.  The atmosphere is very picturesque as the restaurant is situated right on the ocean.  When we were seated, our waiter Michael greeted us with a smile and also offered us congratulatory words.  He was friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, and courteous.  Our meals and cocktails were brought out timely, and were delicious.  If they did nothing more, we would have been thrilled.  But at the end of our meal, they went even further by offering us a complementary Hula Pie, their signature dessert.  I would also be remiss if I did not mention that the manager (I did not catch his name) also came over to our table, asked if our experience was satisfactory, and offered his congratulations.\n",

I mean we dined at 4 incredible restaurants the nights before and this was the most delicious dish I have had on this trip.  John gave us excellent service, the right amount of attention without being over the top.  Great job John!

She got us coffee immediately (a must on the first morning), and the 2 different egg servings and hot skillet we ordered were delicious, local and served hot.  There wasn't a spot of food left on any of the 4 plates that morning.\n",

He knew the food, the ingredients and how it was prepared.  He didn't hover, but what available when we needed him.  Exactly the type of service you hope for in a restaurant.  All 4 meals were beyond reproach.  We each had a different fish, prepared in a different way - grilled, broiled, poached.  Each one was tastier than the last and again, nothing remained on anyone's plate.  We arrived at 7:45, and though the place cleared out by 9:15, no one hurried us out at all; no hint of \"here's your hat, where's you hurry\" that's so common when a place is winding down.

The banana pancakes were mediocre, but the breakfast burrito was simply disgusting! Denny's makes better breakfast than Duke's. They put sausage in the burrito when specifically requested them not to and when we told the waitress she just said sorry without offering to replace it.

Luckily the shrimp were cooked right..nice plump and bursting w/ flavor when he bit into it.  The side items were a pesto rice ball and the rice was undercooked and the veggies were cooked bok choi which he said was the worst he's ever had.  Totally overcooked bok choi.  My slices of summer squash and zucchini were also over cooked that I didn't eat them.  My panko crusted Haiku was cooked right and my wild rice was cooked properly.  I did order the Lobster Coconut Soup....no lobster but rather shrimp.  I think they need to correct their menu so people know what they are getting before ordering it. \n",

The coffee was a bit bitter...but I drink shade-grown organic coffee and have no idea what they use here. The slice of pie came out and we should have had 2 more people with us to eat it, it was so large.  Pie was pretty good, but given the poor quality of the expensive meal....83.00 for the food....it just seemed like a big disappointment overall  Nothing special about our dinner just a real let down on our last night in Maui.\n",

I tried the ahi and the Mac nut crusted swordfish, and both meals were some of my best on the island. We also tried the calamari (just do it), the coconut shrimp, the macaroni and cheese side dish (skipable) and the totally forgettable lava cake for dessert. I know I know, you're thinking, \"what an idiot, you eat hula pie in Maui\". But here's a secret: hula pie is just ice cream with a crust. Just a little tip for those of you who think it may be some Hawaiian delicacy. A few forgettable dishes aside, the fish, service, atmosphere, and view are unbeatable. If you are wondering if this place is worth as try, just go ahead and make the stop. It's not so pricey that you will regret it if it's horrible and who knows, you may be like us and eat here twice.
